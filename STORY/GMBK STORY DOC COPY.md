(may have been modified/re-written but general idea and main plot still stands from the gamebook. Modifications to the story (AFTER WRITTEN) should be put in a separate category.  
  
THE TAG [GMBK] WILL BE APPLIED TO MARKERS TO INDICATE THAT THIS IS THE GAMEBOOK VERSION OF THE STORY.) 

##   [GMBK] STORY SETTING

A famous facility, known by the greatest name all around the world. Known for their greatest contributions to science and mankind.  
  
Located in the hill country of Texas. (book said “flats of texas” but the name was wrong)  
They are known all over the world as the best and most respected science foundation, mainly for their highest productivity records and best in class discoveries, that no other foundation has been able to crack.

##  [GMBK] PLOT/INTRO STORY  
  

The day the incident occurred is when you are assigned a never done before experiment with untested equipment. Alongside, you all are working with a new element with completely unknown properties, it has not even been named.  
  
The overseer of facility 20, the facility you are in and the facility conducting the test, is eager to get a new record for the foundation. Obviously this is very fishy of the overseer since his bonus is in a few months if he reaches a quote for tests. And breakthroughs get extra points.  
  
The overseer of the facility has personally added his supervision and best scientists to the team you are on. What test are you conducting? A fusion boiler reaction, also discovered by the foundation, believes that is the best method for discovering the effects of this unknown element.  
But also strangely enough, the fusion boiler has not been tested at all. It has been old equipment not set up properly. Alongside, the head of maintenance said that the boiler is incredibly prone to “stuck function”, meaning that in the wrong moment or minor error in its operation, it will immediately crash and cease to work. But the flaw is that the boiler will continue to operate without any control. The head of maintenance says the boiler needs time to be fixed, modernized, and retrofitted with safety systems to prevent a disaster.  
However, the overseer disagrees, and has ruled that the fusion boiler is in perfect working order and is also supposed to run at 110% its theoretical rated limit. In reality, unknown to the player, the theoretical limit was about 20% this guess. It was doomed to fail from the start.  
  
With this ruling, all your coworkers on the project are very nervous to do this test, but they trust the overseer, and they proceed anyways.  
  
You are assigned the task of setting up the unit from the containment structure, and also set with the task to externally monitor the boiler, since the unit is so old and not compatible with the tech outside the containment structure. But also strangely enough, there is no shutdown system implemented into the boiler, so if all goes wrong, it is stuck running.  
  
Setting up the fusion boiler goes like this;  
Step 1: enable all the relays.  
Step 2: check power system stability. If unstable, stabilize via the control panel.   
Step 3: warm up the fusion inductors  
Step 4: charge the capacitors and do a systems check.  
Step 5: enable the boiler heating coil  
Step 6: open flow of the element to the fusion reactor.  
Step 7: wait until the reactor is full, and until the machine is green to go.  
Final step: start the fusion boiler. 

  
After setup, the team is ready and the test goes on! For the few moments, the test goes well. Unfortunately, the boiler fails, and starts to have issues. As mentioned before, the boiler would stop responding and freeze all control, and thats exactly what happened. Alarms start going off, you try to shutdown the boiler, but inevitably fail.  
  
As the issue goes on, the element goes critical. And a odd pulse of what looks like reality on glass, waves over you. Everything stops, and a mysterious rip on the place in front of you comes up. It goes all the way up and down to the ground, with edges that appear glass like. 

  

You decide to enter this odd looking portal, only to find out that you appear at the front entrance of the foundation. Time is also frozen here, except things aren't quite right.  
  
The sky and everything around seems to be engulfed in a “dome” of what appears to be a glass-shattered like silk. And the image outside is also completely frozen.  
  
  
But as you approach the entrance, its not how it was. It looks like it has been 7 hours after a war or something. Barricades and papers everywhere. Bodies without any wounds all over the place. And not one shell casing or gun in sight. Perhaps this is the signal that this odd situation you are in has caused a cross rift in time?  
  
**==(definitions: a “rift” is basically a portal from one dimension to another. A “cross-rift” is a portal like a normal rift, but can only transport you within itself, or from the original dimension to the cross-dimension. A cross-dimension, or known as a “shared dimension” is a place that is technically its own dimension, but is also sharing the space occupied by the original dimension. Therefor the cross-dimension, or “shared dimension” can only use the slice of space it has reserved from the original dimension)==**  

  
  
Now, this would be a part where the player goes into chapter 1.  
Finally after all that has happened, the player finally gets to walk around and observe the surroundings. 

  

The new goal of the player: to go back down to the fusion boiler, and shut it down somehow.  
  
Now in this beginning phase of the game, lots of early enemies and “[^1]demonstration events” would occur. Alongside they would also be introduced to the first weapon of the game.  
  
==**(DEFINITION: A demonstration event is an event in which its actions can be reflected onto the player as a tutorial explanation. For example; a security guard shooting a rogue entity (like a robber) a few moments after the player picks up the first firearm in the game. The light context in this moment would signal the player that you should shoot entities. or in this case, robbers.)**==  
  
==(PERSONAL OBSERV: Here I would try to keep the story in its current template, but since this is an “action” part of the game where the player is moving around, there is going to be a lot of describing. So maybe when i make revise 2 then itll be cleaner)==
  
As you continue to view the surroundings, you finally notice a weapon you can use in the ticket booth, the Mark23. A .45 ACP handgun, seemingly well worn after being used as someones personal gun.  
There also lies the owners manual for the firearm, also well worn.  
  

==Note: The mark23’s owners manual will be the players introduction on the mark23’s capabilities, and how to use it properly. Like aiming it downsights, what the silencer does, and what do to if it jams, so fourth.==
  
After you pick it up, the player will get an inspect animation of the protagonist examining the firearm. Like holding it, adjusting his grip, checking the chamber, checking the mag, and stuff. All this is done very quickly with dialogue overtop about the protagonist admiring the gun, and commenting on the state of the facility. 

  

==(note: In these parts, the protagonist will start to realise the sheer scale of the incident, starting to put the blame on himself. Since he was the one in charge of most of the outdated boiler’s controls, it must have been his responsibility. Though to realise later in the game, this was not his fault at all.  This is supposed to convey to the player one of the few weaknesses that the protagonist has. In other words, he has an observance of responsibility, and since he was in the position at the time, he feels at fault. And alongside, he cannot accept at the moment that it was some external cause that made the machinery fail.)==

  

Now after you get the gun, you need to get inside the facility. You head to the facility's diagonal truck lift, a huge mobile platform big enough to fit 6, 48ft semi trucks. 

  

You dont need to take the lift, but it is possible. But in order to get into the facility at all, you need to restore the power.  
  
Restoring the power is quite simple, since the facility has many failsaves. On the other side, near the parking lot, is a massive generator building.  
To turn it on, you simply need the override key, since the automated power transfer system has seemingly failed. A maintenance request note on said automatic power transfer system can be seen and read. 

  

The override key is in a glass box, right on the wall, how nice! 

  

So you start the generator, now you head back to the lift to get it ready. There are, however, 2 trucks on the lift, also unsecured. 

  

==( the facility's free fall vertical lift system is a feat of its kind. It uses a scalable platform that goes at the terminal velocity of everything on it. So with a fully loaded platform, it will go approximately 300 kilometers an hour!  But since this system is so fast, all trucks are required to be secured and all drivers are to sit in the jumperseat station, a small room on the platform with overhead harnesses.== 

==To prevent damage to cargo and people on the system due to rapid acceleration, eddy current breaking is used in the beginning parts of the ride down. This makes sure that everything stays on the ground and not tossed in the air and abruptly smashed back down when the breaks hit.==  
==As well, it is able to achieve such high speeds due to using synthetic diamond bearings that are essentially zero friction, heat, and wear!==  
  
==Once all safety systems have been enabled, the system is ready for a drop. The supervisor must press the “arm” button in the control cabin, and the operator can sit in their jumpseat to send the platform below.== 

==Once the ARM button is pressed, a few things start to happen.== 

1. ==The ramp way will retract== 
    
2.  ==The locking lugs on the tire holders for the trucks will engage== 
    
3. ==The ramp hold arms will retract, now the platform is only held by its breaks== 
    
4. ==It will very slowly move to the “launch” zone, the specific, more angled part of ramp where the free fall will happen==
    
5. ==Once its ready, you press the LAUNCH button, and the bell will start ringing! After a few seconds, you start the free fall!== 
    
==Once the platform starts to approach the bottom, the second, louder bell will start to ring. Indicating that the platform is about to start slowing down. How does it achieve this? Via eddy current breaking setup around the track.==  
==The breaking is intended to be hard and somewhat fast, but that is for efficiency. The platform will slowdown about 99% its speed, and that 1% of 300 km/h is still quite fast. Hence why there are big hydraulic dampers==  
  
==Then after the crazy descent and the platform has come to a complete stop, it will automatically engage the platform locks and place the ramp down, and also the locking lugs holding the trucks will completely disengage, allowing the trucks to move freely.==  
  
==The way the platform goes up is automatic, a high-speed cable system will connect to the platform, dragging it back up the hill at a steady 150 km/h. Though since this system is going up, it takes a while for it to speed up.==  

==As an EE, the player can bring a golf cart with them if they so desire. This will unlock an achievement.==   
  
==SUPPORTING MATH:==  
==Average loaded semi truck and trailer is 40 tons, this platform can carry about 6 of these. The current setting has about 2 loaded trucks.== 

==Each truck is about 60 square meters, so 6 in total would be 360. But nevermind extra space so about 430. The platform is also so huge, so add an extra 90 tons. Total weight when fully loaded; 240 for 6 trucks. 80 for the current setting of 2. 330 tons with 6 trucks and platform, 170 tons for the setting of 2 trucks including platform.==
