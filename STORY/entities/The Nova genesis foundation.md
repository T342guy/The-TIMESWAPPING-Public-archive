# What is The Nova genesis foundation? 

The Nova genesis foundation, also known as [^1]The NGF, is a science foundation founded on August 6th, 1971 by [[Dr. William H. bakerfield]]. it was founded on the core belief that science can be so much more then what it currently was at the time of its founding.


# The history of [^1]The NGF

The Nova genesis foundation first served as a identity for [[Dr. William H. bakerfield]] to post his discoveries with the rest of the world. His main hope being that other foundations would notice, and start a collaboration to make groundbreaking discoveries. 

However, that isn't what he had gotten. The discoveries he had published were often criticised for being too vague, incredibly dangerous, or flat out science fiction attempted to be proved right. 

After constantly being named a fraud, [[Dr. William H. bakerfield]] had enough. Instead of the name being a place to publish his discoveries, he transformed it into a real foundation, and bought an old building for its labs. 

When the first lab for [^1]The NGF was opened, it was 1974. 
Initially, for the first few months of operation, it was very quiet. Though one fateful day, his friend, nicknamed [[Og]], needed a job. he was fairly good in science, so [[Dr. William H. bakerfield]] added him to the team and they were working solo until 1976. 
In July of 1976, exactly July 19th of 1976, Both [[Dr. William H. bakerfield]] and his friend, [[Og]],  created a successful event of gravity-based suspension. 

This was a groundbreaking discovery for the time, as the prototype could carry 3x its supplied weight of the arms. How did it work? 
The prototype used 5, hand-woven inductors that were oriented in a 4x4 and one on the bottom. they were able to successfully float a wooden cube about 60grams in weight, for about 30 seconds. 

[[Dr. William H. bakerfield]] said on the day in his logs and [^2]on the paper:
> "This is the happiest day for me, and for all of science!"  


After that very day, the foundation had received a lot of praise, mostly due to creating a prototype that was groundbreaking! Henceforth, Many high-level students desired to work for [^1]The NGF, marking a truly remarkable beginning to the foundation. 



Past these moments, [^1]The NGF was full of high-level grads, open to new ideas, and their respect as a science source skyrocketed out of the ground! Then also at the time, being 1977, [[Dr. William H. bakerfield]] took the position of Head administrator of the entire foundation, yet still putting himself in spots that were considered lowly for such a high status. 
His act of kindness and humility was often scrutinized, mainly because it was very uncommon of someone with such worth to put themselves in the same spot as others. 

At the beginning of 1977, after the foundation was basically fully established, [[Dr. William H. bakerfield]] decided its time to advance, and started construction on one of the (were to be) many facilities. [[Facility Genesis]], quite well named. as well, the amount of funding he had gotten due to the surge of activity was enormous! so they were able to complete [[Facility Genesis]] in only 3 years.

In 1980, [[Facility Genesis]] was complete! 
Going forward, the foundation gathered even more bright minds
