# Overview 

Facility genesis was the first officially constructed and operated facility for [[The Nova genesis foundation]]. It was an above and below ground structure, taking use of an old abandoned mine as the underground structure. 

Facility genesis was able to be built in just 3 years due to the mine already there, and quick construction of the offices.

The construction was fairly simple, a large plot of flat land had a concrete slap poured, to be built on top of as storage. Then the offices were built into the mountain, directly over top the mines. 

Facility genesis also featured multi-ground elevators that made it easier for scientists to go to their offices or down to the testing grounds.
