# TIMESWAPING BRAINSTORMING/PLANNING FILE

  

Hello there! If you are reading this, you have entered into the magical land of headache in a page!  
What does this file contain? This page is everything, or at least most, of all the brainstorming and revising to the game TIMESWAPING! This is everything from sketched stories, to revised story, to mechanics brainstorming and more!  
  
Though this may seem small, PLEASE DO NOT SHARE ANY EXTERNAL LINKS TO THIS PAGE IN ANY VOLUME UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED!!!!

  

This document basically contains almost every part of the story and maybe some stuff extra, so it would be a great nice as a reminder to not share.  
The only reason you may even have this link to view this document is because I, T342, trust whoever is on the other side receiving this link to not leak information.  
  
  
  
  

  

#   REFERENCES TO OTHER GAMES OR WORKS.

- a gold coin, apon inspection, has a backwards THE FINALS logo on it.  
    

- A random garden nome, a reference to VALVe’s achievements where you need to bring said nome to the end of the game. 
    

  
  

# EASTER EGGS/SURROUNDING JOKES

  
- make the number 57 pop up frequently as a joke/gag  
      
    
- There will be one specific monitor in a storage room with a option to pick it up, when you do, the description will be unlike a normal one and say "something hides in the screen?”. This is due to the monitor having a very faint burn-in of the pixilworks games logo.  
      
    

  

# INSPIRATION MATERIAL

- World War 2 history, from the death stranding parts. 
    
- Death stranding 2 has issues where the “beaches” can transform into other things. For example; the military vet, Cliff, has his entire beach turned into the WW2 era zone. WAYS TO MAKE STORY WORK LIKE THIS; the story already involves rifts and rips in time, so adding parts of the game where you are transported to historic moments could be a feature. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9usphFTaOTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9usphFTaOTA)
    
- Since the game is transferring between multiple types of dimensions, the music in each other space should change accordingly, but still “feel” the same. In other words, its different style, but aligns. 
    
- Some of the original inspiration for the story is based off of the OG half-life’s black mesa facility incident. 
    
- In loki, the part where he uses the machine to question one of the rogue guards, there is a machine that can apparently create and manipulate space for confinement purposes. Aswell, it appears the same material is used in the tech pads for jumps between time branches. [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yZtPbb4sKvg](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yZtPbb4sKvg)  
      
    
- Atomic heart, a game set within the world of a retro-futuristic past. Where the soviet union won world war 2, and beyond where robots are to assist everyone. The game’s year appears to be 1980s, or even later, since they do mention this being the future of the soviet union.  
    In the game, the entire place is normal. everyone is ready to celebrate the launch of the kollective 2.0 neural network, the towns are full of people and are happy doing all.  
    You, the player, are agent P-3. sir doctor sechenov’s best friend, and right hand man.  
    In the main story, past the plot and along gameplay, all the robots turn rouge. Your new goal? To find a person named viktor petrov. He was the one responsible for corrupting the robot systems.  
      
    
- [https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5Vb8243LTI&si=QMXysC55BiG68Rww](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5Vb8243LTI&si=QMXysC55BiG68Rww)  
    This inspires a moment when the main character is at the lowest point, but also the game is ending, where everything reverts to when it was. Maybe the best way to explain it is when the main character is sacrificing himself for the rest of the people at the facility? The slow, "remembering" part is where the moment happens, then fades into this happy recall of everything being rebuilt to how it was. 
    

  
  

# MECHANICS, FUNCTIONS, OR OTHER INTERACTABLE BRAINSTORMING/IDEALOG

- The gravity is very spontaneous, so some places may have floating objects, some may have heavy objects, some may be just fine, or a transcend between floating, heavy, and normal. 
        
- A high quality inspection and description system for pickup-able objects 
    
- Controller support with high-quality key images, including for controller and PC. 
    
- Add some form of diagonal elevator, and considering the theme of the story, this may be likely [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2oELc61XHE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2oELc61XHE)   (FULFILLED BY THE [[FFVLS]])
    
- “Arm sway” like in titan station. Where the arms rubberband around the screen in a cool manner 
    
- Add some sort of visual indicator, like a micro waypoint for pickupables.
    
- A powerful kick mechanic that can knock down doors, break stuff open, and deal damage + knock back to enemies
    
- A audio recording/playback storytelling perspective. Finding audio recordings around and playing them back, like chirpers from Atomic heart 
    
- ? An size-based inventory system like Arc raiders or escape from tarkov 
    
- An upgrade system introduced later in the beginning of the game, that will also follow along the games’s story.  
    
- MAKE SURE TO DO THE +1 WHEN DOING RELOADS IT ALWAYS SUCKS TO NOT SEE THE +1 IN THE CHAMBER AAAAAAAA

# CURRENT STORY VIA GAMEBOOK

(may have been modified/re-written but general idea and main plot still stands from the gamebook. Modifications to the story (AFTER WRITTEN) should be put in a separate category.  
  
THE TAG [GMBK] WILL BE APPLIED TO MARKERS TO INDICATE THAT THIS IS THE GAMEBOOK VERSION OF THE STORY.) 

##   [GMBK] STORY SETTING

A famous facility, known by the greatest name all around the world. Known for their greatest contributions to science and mankind.  
  
Located in the hill country of Texas. (book said “flats of texas” but the name was wrong)  
They are known all over the world as the best and most respected science foundation, mainly for their highest productivity records and best in class discoveries, that no other foundation has been able to crack.

##  [GMBK] PLOT/INTRO STORY  
  

The day the incident occurred is when you are assigned a never done before experiment with untested equipment. Alongside, you all are working with a new element with completely unknown properties, it has not even been named.  
  
The overseer of facility 20, the facility you are in and the facility conducting the test, is eager to get a new record for the foundation. Obviously this is very fishy of the overseer since his bonus is in a few months if he reaches a quote for tests. And breakthroughs get extra points.  
  
The overseer of the facility has personally added his supervision and best scientists to the team you are on. What test are you conducting? A fusion boiler reaction, also discovered by the foundation, believes that is the best method for discovering the effects of this unknown element.  
But also strangely enough, the fusion boiler has not been tested at all. It has been old equipment not set up properly. Alongside, the head of maintenance said that the boiler is incredibly prone to “stuck function”, meaning that in the wrong moment or minor error in its operation, it will immediately crash and cease to work. But the flaw is that the boiler will continue to operate without any control. The head of maintenance says the boiler needs time to be fixed, modernized, and retrofitted with safety systems to prevent a disaster.  
However, the overseer disagrees, and has ruled that the fusion boiler is in perfect working order and is also supposed to run at 110% its theoretical rated limit. In reality, unknown to the player, the theoretical limit was about 20% this guess. It was doomed to fail from the start.  
  
With this ruling, all your coworkers on the project are very nervous to do this test, but they trust the overseer, and they proceed anyways.  
  
You are assigned the task of setting up the unit from the containment structure, and also set with the task to externally monitor the boiler, since the unit is so old and not compatible with the tech outside the containment structure. But also strangely enough, there is no shutdown system implemented into the boiler, so if all goes wrong, it is stuck running.  
  
Setting up the fusion boiler goes like this;  
Step 1: enable all the relays.  
Step 2: check power system stability. If unstable, stabilize via the control panel.   
Step 3: warm up the fusion inductors  
Step 4: charge the capacitors and do a systems check.  
Step 5: enable the boiler heating coil  
Step 6: open flow of the element to the fusion reactor.  
Step 7: wait until the reactor is full, and until the machine is green to go.  
Final step: start the fusion boiler. 

  
After setup, the team is ready and the test goes on! For the few moments, the test goes well. Unfortunately, the boiler fails, and starts to have issues. As mentioned before, the boiler would stop responding and freeze all control, and thats exactly what happened. Alarms start going off, you try to shutdown the boiler, but inevitably fail.  
  
As the issue goes on, the element goes critical. And a odd pulse of what looks like reality on glass, waves over you. Everything stops, and a mysterious rip on the place in front of you comes up. It goes all the way up and down to the ground, with edges that appear glass like. 

  

You decide to enter this odd looking portal, only to find out that you appear at the front entrance of the foundation. Time is also frozen here, except things aren't quite right.  
  
The sky and everything around seems to be engulfed in a “dome” of what appears to be a glass-shattered like silk. And the image outside is also completely frozen.  
  
  
But as you approach the entrance, its not how it was. It looks like it has been 7 hours after a war or something. Barricades and papers everywhere. Bodies without any wounds all over the place. And not one shell casing or gun in sight. Perhaps this is the signal that this odd situation you are in has caused a cross rift in time?  
  
(definitions: a “rift” is basically a portal from one dimension to another. A “cross-rift” is a portal like a normal rift, but can only transport you within itself, or from the original dimension to the cross-dimension. A cross-dimension, or known as a “shared dimension” is a place that is technically its own dimension, but is also sharing the space occupied by the original dimension. Therefor the cross-dimension, or “shared dimension” can only use the slice of space it has reserved from the original dimension)  

  
  
Now, this would be a part where the player goes into chapter 1.  
Finally after all that has happened, the player finally gets to walk around and observe the surroundings. 

  

The new goal of the player is to go back down to the fusion boiler, and shut it down somehow.  
  
Now in this beginning phase of the game, lots of early enemies and “demonstration events” would occur. Alongside they would also be introduced to the first weapon of the game.  
  
(A demonstration event is an event in which its actions can be reflected onto the player as a tutorial explanation. For example; a security guard shooting a rogue entity (like a robber) a few moments after the player picks up the first firearm in the game. The light context in this moment would signal the player that you should shoot entities. or in this case, robbers.)  
  
[ Here I would try to keep the story in its current template, but since this is an “action” part of the game where the player is moving around, there is going to be a lot of describing. So maybe when i make revise 2 then itll be cleaner ]  
  
As you continue to view the surroundings, you finally notice a weapon you can use in the ticket booth, the Mark23. A .45 ACP handgun, seemingly well worn after being used as someones personal gun.  
There also lies the owners manual for the firearm, also well worn.  
  

[ The mark23’s owners manual will be the players introduction on the mark23’s capabilities, and how to use it properly. Like aiming it downsights, what the silencer does, and what do to if it jams, so fourth. ]  
  
After you pick it up, the player will get an inspect animation of the protagonist examining the firearm. Like holding it, adjusting his grip, checking the chamber, checking the mag, and stuff. All this is done very quickly with dialogue overtop about the protagonist admiring the gun, and commenting on the state of the facility. 

  

[ In these parts, the protagonist will start to realise the sheer scale of the incident, starting to put the blame on himself. Since he was the one in charge of most of the outdated boiler’s controls, it must have been his responsibility. Though to realise later in the game, this was not his fault at all.  This is supposed to convey to the player one of the few weaknesses that the protagonist has. In other words, he has an observance of responsibility, and since he was in the position at the time, he feels at fault. And alongside, he cannot accept at the moment that it was some external cause that made the machinery fail. ]

  

Now after you get the gun, you need to get inside the facility. You head to the facility's diagonal truck lift, a huge mobile platform big enough to fit 6, 48ft semi trucks. 

  

You dont need to take the lift, but it is possible. But in order to get into the facility at all, you need to restore the power.  
  
Restoring the power is quite simple, since the facility has many failsaves. On the other side, near the parking lot, is a massive generator building.  
To turn it on, you simply need the override key, since the automated power transfer system has seemingly failed. A maintenance request note on said automatic power transfer system can be seen and read. 

  

The override key is in a glass box, right on the wall, how nice! 

  

So you start the generator, now you head back to the lift to get it ready. There are, however, 2 trucks on the lift, also unsecured. 

  

( the facility's free fall vertical lift system is a feat of its kind. It uses a scalable platform that goes at the terminal velocity of everything on it. So with a fully loaded platform, it will go approximately 300 kilometers an hour!  But since this system is so fast, all trucks are required to be secured and all drivers are to sit in the jumperseat station, a small room on the platform with overhead harnesses. 

  

To prevent damage to cargo and people on the system due to rapid acceleration, eddy current breaking is used in the beginning parts of the ride down. This makes sure that everything stays on the ground and not tossed in the air and abruptly smashed back down when the breaks hit.  
As well, it is able to achieve such high speeds due to using synthetic diamond bearings that are essentially zero friction, heat, and wear!  
  

Once all safety systems have been enabled, the system is ready for a drop. The supervisor must press the “arm” button in the control cabin, and the operator can sit in their jumpseat to send the platform below. 

  

Once the ARM button is pressed, a few things start to happen. 

1. The ramp way will retract 
    
2.  The locking lugs on the tire holders for the trucks will engage 
    
3. The ramp hold arms will retract, now the platform is only held by its breaks 
    
4. It will very slowly move to the “launch” zone, the specific, more angled part of ramp where the free fall will happen
    
5. Once its ready, you press the LAUNCH button, and the bell will start ringing! After a few seconds, you start the free fall! 
    

  
Once the platform starts to approach the bottom, the second, louder bell will start to ring. Indicating that the platform is about to start slowing down. How does it achieve this? Via eddy current breaking setup around the track.  
The breaking is intended to be hard and somewhat fast, but that is for efficiency. The platform will slowdown about 99% its speed, and that 1% of 300 km/h is still quite fast. Hence why there are big hydraulic dampers  
  
Then after the crazy descent and the platform has come to a complete stop, it will automatically engage the platform locks and place the ramp down, and also the locking lugs holding the trucks will completely disengage, allowing the trucks to move freely.  
  
The way the platform goes up is automatic, a high-speed cable system will connect to the platform, dragging it back up the hill at a steady 150 km/h. Though since this system is going up, it takes a while for it to speed up.  

  

As an EE, the player can bring a golf cart with them if they so desire. This will unlock an achievement.   
  

SUPPORTING MATH:  
Average loaded semi truck and trailer is 40 tons, this platform can carry about 6 of these. The current setting has about 2 loaded trucks. 

Each truck is about 60 square meters, so 6 in total would be 360. But nevermind extra space so about 430. The platform is also so huge, so add an extra 90 tons. Total weight when fully loaded; 240 for 6 trucks. 80 for the current setting of 2. 330 tons with 6 trucks and platform, 170 tons for the setting of 2 trucks including platform.

IN TOTAL; the maximum terminal velocity for a fully loaded platform of 6 trucks is about 376 km/h! Thats over my estimate!  
  
[www.timecalculator.net/speed-distance-time-calculator](http://www.timecalculator.net/speed-distance-time-calculator)  
  
How can this be added to the game?  
There can be a check where all the weight on the platform can enter an equation that will change the speed of the platform (in case the player adds more or less vehicles onto the platform)  ) 

  
  
  
  

# PLANNED STORY/MODIFICATIONS

NOTE; THE FOLLOWING TAGS SHOW INTENT FOR IDEA.  
[INTNT] - Intent, meaning that this will ideally be added into the game.  
[PLNNED] - a PLANNED feature included into the game, that was not already described in the latest revision of the story.  
[DMO] - DEMO, meaning that this is an idea not entirely rounded, sure that it would fit into the game or the game scope, or another reason that can be described.  
  

- [INTNT] In the start of the game, the player has moments where they first sign up, but then these phase back to reality and appear as flashbacks for the player. Then upon returning, you come back to the parking lot in front of the main building. Then past these parts you start an average day, then you leave.  
    Upon return, you say to yourself today may be a bit different, but staying positive! But alas, unknown to the player at this moment, this is when the incident will occur. The day goes normal and you pass by a lot of other coworkers talking about the experiment you are partaking in. this is the beginning of the game, and intended to be the main introduction for your place in this facility. Alongside, you are also required to talk to your fellow coworkers about work, as an introduction to the player. This is intended to give the player a good feel for your place in this workspace, what the main character's role is, what their connections are, and interests via chatting with coworkers. Interaction between them may show that the main character is good friends with some, or enemies, brothers in arms, or just normal coworkers that dont know each other too well.  
      
    
- [PLNNED] The chapter based story system. I had forgotten to add this into the initial write, due to it being wayyy later in the game book, or perhaps i have just forgotten about it at the time.  
      
    
- [PLNNED] The contextual story system. The contextual story system is a method of storytelling based off of context and “outlines” used in other pieces of context, mentally assembled into a “line” of context. For example; in law, they use a method of detecting if a story is rehearsed or if it is a real moment. Each story of its own memory is essentially the same, with minor divots in the story to show memory fade as a normal person would experience when recalling a memory. If it lines up to the “base” of the intent of the story, it is true. If it is rehearsed and matches very similarly, that is a automatic red flag when storytelling that what was said was directly taken from the storyline, or a lie written out.  
    This method of storytelling will be used quite often, since all or most characters are dead/corrupted by the incident. And also considering the fact that it has technically been about 7 hours after the initial explosion to the moment where the player starts11| the game, there are going to be notes everywhere.  
    Example of the system; there is a generator, the generator has a note on top of it. The player can or cant read it if they want. Upon reading it, it may contain an inspector's assessment that the generator has faulty cabling, and apon use may fail.  
    When the player tries to start the generator and it does short out, this context of assessment is part where the player now knows what happened.  
    Another example; all around the place are going to be notes from lots of different people. All have different ways of writhing/typing things out so all may differ, but most importantly each note of a different topic should portray all the feelings and current ideas roaming around inside their heads. Maybe it may go along as “what the hell is going on??? The overseer is quite panicked and is also not sure what to do, but he refuses to say what is going on! I heard an explosion earlier, perhaps the fusion boiler? I heard they were going to use it today. Though the overseer did say it was fit for operation, so surely it cant be that!” and more and more notes going around with different context for what they think happened and so fourth.  
      
    
- [DMO] The plot element of the game. I hadn't thought of a plot element, nor did I know, so here is what I think would fit into my vision. I have 2 different ideas, I will list them out here.  
    The rebirth plot element. “An event forces the protagonist to change their ways and often become a better person.”  
    First off, why do I think this is an ideal way to build the story? Well, the main protagonist could be some sort of jackass, asshole, meanie, bully, or some other reason. Then through the story they transform into someone more.  
    Now here is the one i really agree with; The rule of three.  
    The rule of three is a plot element where the protagonist experiences three events, and the third is where the transformation happens.  
    “ The third event in a series of events becomes "the final trigger for something important to happen." This pattern appears in childhood stories such as "[Goldilocks and the Three Bears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_and_the_Three_Bears)", "[Cinderella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella)", and "[Little Red Riding Hood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Red_Riding_Hood)".  
    In adult stories, [the Rule of Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_\(writing\)) conveys the gradual resolution of a process that leads to transformation. This transformation can be downwards as well as upwards. “  
    This can be used where the protagonist is generally a good guy, but has weaknesses that are revealed in the game. Then with these 3 moments, are slowly healed, then in the third moment, take full transformation as the protagonist takes these to heart.  
      
    
- [DMO] To edit the idea of how the cross-dimensions works, i had a strike where if the dimension the protagonist “copies” the original dimension, and everything in it, at least the part that was reserved.  
    The gamebook describes enemies as controlled puppets, the time storm can take any “puppet” and assert control of it. Aswell, no same person can exist twice, at any given point. So since this cross-dimension is a copy that is technically its own and a reach withing the original, the outside space from the time storm has the template and reserved space, including all the people inside. So then when the dimension is copied, the people are also copies. But cannot be alive 2 at a time. So the template dimension is where everyone is still alive, but in stasis. But also, time cannot continue in both, so the template is held in a state of suspension and the copied dimension is the one that reserves that time. This way, everyone is technically already dead, but still alive.  
      
    
- [DMO] How does the ending of the game work? I rase this question due to how the cross-dimension is set up. Since the “template” is the part of the original dimension, its time is reserved for the copy, and all action henceforth happens in the copy, what happens when the game is over? When the fusion boiler gets disabled and the time storm reverts? Well here are a few things.  
    All movement that happened in the copy will be applied to the template before the storm ends. So say if there was a coffee cup somewhere, then i move it in the copy, then the storm ends. The cup will appear in the spot it was placed in the copy. So per se if someone moves inside, a person, that person will be moved into their new position. Then when the storm ends, they will wake up in that position. Then also due to template-copy stasis, all of these guys will be completely still, but also clinically dead to medical equipment. Then again, they still have a pulse and are breathing. You also, cannot hurt anyone in the copy due to the time storm and the template-copy stasis.
