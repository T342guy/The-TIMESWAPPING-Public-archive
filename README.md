# The TIMESWAPPING public archive

Hello all! Welcome to my TIMESWAPPING public archive. 

You may be asking yourself, "what even is TIMESWAPPING?". Im glad you asked! 

TIMESWAPPING was supposed to be my major game project I had in mind. I was very exited to think about it, and it was honestly pretty fun to think about may things that would tie into a story.\
It was also my VERY FIRST TIME acctually writing a thing of this sheer scale, and I think it shows! Though, most things dont come the first time. 

So, what happened to the project?\
Well, I kinda tangled myself in the minor details, made it pretty large, and then also made it very confusing for myself to understand.\
Then at the same time, I was fixating on the story and minor details, at how cool they were, and not the actual things the player would acctually notice. 

So, I just stopped working on it. Eventually declaring the project shelved. 
Its been about a year now, the project is still shelved, and I have no confidince that I will return to the full idea.\
After all, my vision on the project was very unclear. Though I may take a detail here or there, the full project itself will most likely not return. 

So, I decided it would be a good thing to show my past work to the public in a Public archive under a creative commons licence. 

I hope you enjoy this project as much as I did when it was around, but alas, it had to end somewhere.\
But, if any of you find this and one of you make this a spinoff or reality, please, dont hesitate to contact me!\
I would really love to see the work that you have created ontop of my work that hopefully inspired somthing in all of you reading this.
