The dimensional theory is an outline of how dimensions work in the context of the [[Facility 20]] incident 

FROM GDOC:
> To edit the idea of how the cross-dimensions works, i had a strike where if the dimension the protagonist “copies” the original dimension, and everything in it, at least the part that was reserved.  
    The gamebook describes enemies as controlled puppets, the time storm can take any “puppet” and assert control of it. Aswell, no same person can exist twice, at any given point. So since this cross-dimension is a copy that is technically its own and a reach withing the original, the outside space from the time storm has the template and reserved space, including all the people inside. So then when the dimension is copied, the people are also copies. But cannot be alive 2 at a time. So the template dimension is where everyone is still alive, but in stasis. But also, time cannot continue in both, so the template is held in a state of suspension and the copied dimension is the one that reserves that time. This way, everyone is technically already dead, but still alive.  


# Definitions 
This page will get quite confusing, so here are some definitions that will help you read this. 

- The "origin" is the central dimension where the protagonist originates from, and where the original material is from.
- The "Template" is a zone where the origin's places are copied into the copy zone.
- The "Copy" is the area the protagonist is placed in and acts in. It is a material copy of the template, and the time from the template has been replaced into the copy zone.
- The "Storm" Is the time storm covering the entire event. This is what allows the copy and template zones to exist.

--- 

The dimensional theory is as shown.

There are 4 central parts to this theory. 
1. The inner and outer "storms" 
2. The "template" and "copy" zones
3. The use of time itself within these. 
4. The horizon point 

# The inner and outer "storms"

The Inner and outer storms are a Horizon between events of temporal distortion. It is an impenetrable and seemingly non-matter type of separation. its like a wall, that isnt quite a wall.

The purpose of these "walls" are to protect the horizons between them, as it would be impossible to have anything happen if no time exists. 


# The template and copy zones 

The template and copy zones are occurrences that is what referred as an "cross-dimension". 

In essence, this is how it is placed out; 
The Template is a part of the origin. The template is *still* a part of the origin, yet its time has been reserved for the copy. 

Another way of saying it, The time from the template has been stripped away to be used in the Copy.

## The copy cross-dimension. 

The copy is a dimension within the origin, that is a direct copy of the template. 
(Hence why it is named the copy.)
The copy also houses an inner storm wall, this is also pearly solid due to the fact that this is *technically* in another dimension

and though people are still in the copy, they are not alive in the normal sense due to their souls still occupied by the origin template. so they are alive, but they are in what is called "stasis". 

Then again, time in the template has been transferred to the copy, so everyone is technically dead and alive at the same time.

> This is used so that technically everyone in the copy is alive, but their original is still alive as well. so the copies are not alive, yet they are.

# Time distortion 

Time is really wanky in the origin template and copy. 

Due to the fact that the copy is the template within the same dimension, time is reactant to the same degree. so you cant have 2 identical places occupying the same time, WITH the fact that if you were to move something in the copy, it should move in the origin template. 

Therefor, time in the origin template's storm is completely stripped away and moved to the copy. it is the same time, though it also isnt.
