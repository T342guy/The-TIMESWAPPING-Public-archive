The free fall vertical lift system, also known as the [^1]FFVLS, is a marvel of its kind. It is a state-of-the-art ultra high speed transportation platform. Intended to operate at terminal velocity, it is an engineering marvel, and a gemstone of [[Facility 20]].

# The [^1]FFVLS 

The [^1]FFVLS was initially designed by [[The Nova genesis foundation]] in the design and construction of [[Facility 20]]. 

The purpose of the lift was to create an incredibly seamless, time saving way of transporting good from the top to the bottom.

Conventional methods of driving trucks all the way down a spiral or zig-zag road was a very inefficient use of time, space, and building recourses at the time.

What was more important to the foundation, is that there is a system that is convent for the drivers of the trucks, easy to load and unload, and has rapid deployment. 

So the facility's engineers came up with the revolutionary system called The free fall vertical lift system! Also commonly referred as the [^1]FFVLS. 

# Development of the [^1]FFVLS
The introduction of the idea was swift and open-shut, because it was exactly what the foundation was looking for. Though some hurdles needed to be overcome. 

First of all, the system is intended to run at terminal velocity, from a 77 degree angle. How is it possible to prevent overheating or breakdown with incredible speeds of such a massive machine? The engineers of the foundation solved this by using old ideas of synthetic diamond bearings. They are essentially zero friction, low heat, no grease, and very little maintenance required. 

Second issue, how can you control the speed of acceleration and breaking without large breaks? And more importantly, that would require frequent maintenance with expensive materials. 
The engineers also solved this issue by taking the eddy current phenomenon to its use, by applying "forks" To the track, and variable magnetic coils on the platforms "ride train". 
The magnetic field could increase and decrease gradually for a smooth transition to terminal velocity, and vice versa. 

Third issue, how can the platform arrive at the bottom without smashing into the mating platform edge? The engineers put this to a great idea of using a flush, connected edge of the platform that was hydraulically connected. Also named the "Flush hydraulic dampener". 

Fourth issue, how can the platform return back to the top? The engineers used the method that most elevators use, a dual counterweight retraction method. this is an immobile cable that will link to the platform at the bottom, the counterweight at the top, and the very powerful hydraulic motor, all will drag the platform back up at about 200km/h! or if it is loaded, this time will require more acceleration.

[^1]: "FFVLS" is a shortening of "Free fall vertical lift system".
