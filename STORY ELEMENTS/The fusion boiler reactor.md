# What is the fusion boiler reactor? 

The fusion boiler reactor, also commonly referred as [^1]"The boiler" or "The fusion boiler", is a piece of scientific equipment partner developed and manufactured by a third-party contractor for [[The Nova genesis foundation]], but the ultimate principle was discovered by the foundation. 

[^1]The fusion boiler uses two main principles for its operation. First, it houses 4 fusion diodes that operate on a continuous axis to make sure that distribution of its ions coming in contact with the boiler bell is smooth. 

Second part of its main principle is a heating coil integrated containment bell. this allows for direct heat with constant spread of the heat, reducing warm spots as much as possible, to reduce fatigue.

The boiler bell is made out of Molybdenum Chromoly Steel, mainly due to its very high service temp. The service temp is rated for 1,550°C. Alongside, There is a very very thin layer of tungsten for security, that can hold up to 2,500°C. 

The other systems of the boiler include a 1930's interface of buttons and relays. 

# The flaws of the fusion boiler reactor 

The fusion boiler used in the test that happened in 1999 was a prototype unit from 1982, that [[Facility Genesis]] discovered the main principles of fusion boiler reactions. But due to its only minor use in [[Facility Genesis]], [[Facility 20]] was unable to control nor monitor the boiler from the containment room.
